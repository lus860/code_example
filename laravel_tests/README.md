# **Laravel HTTP Tests**


Laravel provides a very fluent API for making HTTP requests to your application and examining the responses.
To make a request to your application, you may invoke the get, post, put, patch, or delete methods within your test. These methods do not actually issue a "real" HTTP request to your application. Instead, the entire network request is simulated internally.
